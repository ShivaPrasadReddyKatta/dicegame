This dice game is famously known as PIG game and involves two players. During their turn, the player will roll the die repeatedly and all the points will be accumulated under the current score section. However, if the player rolls a 1 then all the points will be lost and the chance will be given to the next player. If the player decides to hold the score before rolling a 1 then all the points under the current score will be transferred to the main score and the turn will be given to the next player. The player to reach 100 first will be the winner. Note that even if the player rolls a 1 the main score will not be affected and only the current score will be lost.
